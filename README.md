## Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: [0-bubble_sort.c](0-bubble_sort.c) – Implements the bubble sort algorithm.  
2. **Insertion Sort**: [1-insertion_sort_list.c](1-insertion_sort_list.c) – Implements the insertion sort algorithm.  
3. **Selection Sort**: [2-selection_sort.c](2-selection_sort.c) – Implements the selection sort algorithm.  
4. **Quick Sort**: [3-quick_sort.c](3-quick_sort.c) – Implements the quick sort algorithm.  

- [sort.h](sort.h): Header file with function prototypes and struct definitions.
